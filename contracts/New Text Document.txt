# Magic Dice Contract

this contract was compiled with [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/). I copied the artifact (metadata) files from there since they already contain the abi and bytecode needed to instantiate the contract locally.
>abi = artifacts/CONTRACT_NAME_metadata.json
>bytecode = artifacts/CONTRACT_NAME.json
